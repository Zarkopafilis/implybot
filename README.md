# implybot
Once upon a time, a server called `>implying programming community` was thriving in discord lands. 
@[marios8543](https://github.com/marios8543) was kind enough to export as much chat log data as he could.

## What does this repo do

We trained an Seq 2 Seq RNN starting from fasttext english word embeddings (dimensionality 300) to see if we could get
some sort of non-robotlike response.

## Results
WIP

## Try it yourself
- Run the notebook and train the model
- On the bottom of the notebook, use `decode_sequence` to chat with it.

### Dataset
The dataset is by no means politically correct or safe for work. This is an anonymous discord chat. We already know that chatbots trained on the wild internet tend to get racist, suicidal, etc. The text content produced by this machine learning system do not represent our opinions.

If you wish to have access to the dataset, send an email to `zarkopafilis@gmail.com` with subject `[implybot] Dataset Request`.
