# implybot
Once upon a time, a server called `>implying programming community` was thriving in discord lands. 
@[marios8543](https://github.com/marios8543) was kind enough to export anonymously as much chat log data as he could.

## What does this repo do

We trained an Seq 2 Seq RNN starting from fasttext english word embeddings (dimensionality 300) to see if we could get
some sort of non-robotlike response.

## Results


## Try it yourself
- Run the notebook and save the trained model
- `python -m chat.py`
